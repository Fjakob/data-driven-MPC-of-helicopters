Choose aggressive controller, s.t. alpha stays around 0°, i.e.
Q = blkdiag(500,1,5,1,1,1)

Experimentally tune u_dist and t_dist, result:
u_disturb = 0.2;
t_disturb = 0.3;

Start in -30° initial condition, set as reference:
x_goal = [0/180*pi; 0; -105/180*pi; 0; 0; 0]

-> leads to beta staying around -30° and afterwards, to good closed
   loop performance
